## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue js](https://vuejs.org/) - JavaScript Framework
- [Tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I used this challenge to get back to tailwindcss and keep practicing basic layout composition in vue js.

### Continued development

I need to find a way on how to optimize automatically the images and lower my CLS.

### Useful resources

- [tailwindcss documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - I had to regularly search in the documentation for the correct tailwin syntax. command + k for the quick search helped a lot.
